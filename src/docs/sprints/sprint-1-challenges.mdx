# Sprint 1 Challenges

## CSS Blog Challenge

In this challenge you are going to add some CSS to your Blog!

1. Navigate to your Blog folder.
2. Create a new folder called styles inside your Blog folder 
```
mkdir styles
```
3. Inside this folder, create a file called main.css 
```
touch main.css
```

Each HTML file needs to be explicitly linked to a CSS file. 

To link these two files together add this line between the `<head>` and `</head>` tags in your index.html file:

```
<link href="/styles/main.css"Â rel="stylesheet"Â type="text/css">
```

In your main.css file try adding some of the CSS you learnt from FreeCodeCamp.
Once you have finished, upload your work to GitHub and post the link to your repo **here**

## Unplugged Activity

Throughout this sprint there will be time put aside on a day (to be decided) where we will put down the tools and participate in an unplugged activity. For this activity you will begin
writing a blog with key information included (name, age, family etc). After having written out a short draft of your blog you will format it using html tags. To extend on this task, you will
then format your html script with css.

The final task will be taking your unplugged handwritten code, and publishing it in VS code for final submission and review.
